# Frontend Container Final Fix

Based on the diagnostic output, I've identified the following issues with the frontend container:

## Current Status

1. **Process Status**: ✅ The `next-server` process is running with PID 1
2. **Environment Variables**: ✅ All required environment variables are set correctly
3. **File System**: ✅ The server.js file exists and the .next directory is present
4. **Next.js Build**: ✅ Both `server` and `standalone` directories exist in .next
5. **Network Status**: ✅ Port 3000 is being listened on by the container (172.22.0.3:3000)
6. **Backend Connectivity**: ✅ The backend is healthy and responding with a 200 status code
7. **Frontend Health**: ❌ The frontend is not responding on localhost:3000

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is that while the container is listening on port 3000 (172.22.0.3:3000), it's not responding to requests on localhost:3000. This suggests that:

1. The Next.js server might not be binding to all interfaces
2. The server might be running but not handling requests correctly
3. There might be a networking issue within the container

The server.js file shows that it's using:
```javascript
const hostname = process.env.HOSTNAME || '0.0.0.0'
```

This should bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), but something is preventing it from responding to localhost requests.

## Solution

### 1. Restart the Node.js Server

First, try restarting the Node.js server:

```bash
# Find the PID of the next-server process
ps aux | grep next-server

# Kill the process (replace 1 with the actual PID if different)
kill 1

# Start the server manually
node server.js
```

### 2. Check for Binding Issues

If that doesn't work, modify the server.js file to explicitly bind to localhost:

```bash
# Create a temporary server.js file that explicitly binds to localhost
cat > test-server.js << 'EOF'
const http = require('http');
const { parse } = require('url');
const next = require('next');

const app = next({ dev: false });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true);
    handle(req, res, parsedUrl);
  });
  
  server.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on http://0.0.0.0:3000');
    console.log('> Also listening on http://localhost:3000');
  });
});
EOF

# Run the test server
node test-server.js
```

### 3. Check for Network Configuration Issues

If the above solutions don't work, check the network configuration:

```bash
# Check if localhost is properly configured in /etc/hosts
cat /etc/hosts

# Check network interfaces
ip addr

# Check if the container can reach itself
curl -v 172.22.0.3:3000
```

### 4. Verify Next.js Configuration

Check if the Next.js configuration is correct:

```bash
# Check if the standalone directory is properly set up
ls -la .next/standalone

# Check if node_modules are present
ls -la node_modules

# Check for any error logs
grep -r "error" .next/
```

## Long-term Fix

For a more permanent solution, update the Dockerfile.frontend to ensure the server binds to all interfaces:

```dockerfile
# Add an environment variable to explicitly set the hostname
ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0

# Modify the CMD to explicitly bind to all interfaces
CMD ["node", "-e", "const server=require('./server.js'); console.log('Server explicitly bound to all interfaces')"]
```

## Coolify-specific Recommendations

1. **Check Coolify Logs**: Review the container logs in the Coolify dashboard
2. **Restart the Container**: Try restarting the container in Coolify
3. **Update Container Configuration**: Ensure the container has the correct network configuration
4. **Check Port Mapping**: Verify that port 3000 is properly mapped in the Coolify configuration

## Testing the Fix

After implementing any of the above solutions, test the frontend with:

```bash
# Test if the server responds on localhost
curl -v http://localhost:3000

# Test if the server responds on the container IP
curl -v http://172.22.0.3:3000

# Test if the server responds on all interfaces
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

If the server responds correctly, the frontend should now be accessible from outside the container as well.
