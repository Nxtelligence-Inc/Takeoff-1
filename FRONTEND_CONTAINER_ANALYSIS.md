# Frontend Container Analysis

Based on the comprehensive diagnostic output, I've identified the specific issues with the frontend container:

## Confirmed Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**:
   - `Port status: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`
   - The next-server process (PID 1) is already using port 3000
   - This explains why trying to run `node server.js` manually fails

2. **Next.js Build Structure**:
   - The `.next/standalone` directory is missing
   - Instead, there's a `.next/server` directory
   - This indicates the Next.js build is using a different output structure than expected in the Dockerfile

3. **Server.js Location**:
   - The server.js file exists in the root directory
   - It's 6301 bytes in size
   - It's likely the correct file, but it's trying to use a port that's already in use

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause appears to be a mismatch between:

1. How the Next.js application is built (output format)
2. How the Docker container is configured to run it

The Next.js application is building with server files in `.next/server` instead of `.next/standalone`, but the Dockerfile is expecting the standalone output format.

## Solution

### Short-term Fix

1. **Restart the container** in Coolify dashboard
   - This will terminate all processes and start fresh

2. If that doesn't work, **modify the Dockerfile.frontend** to match the actual build output:

```dockerfile
# Copy built application - adjust paths to match actual build output
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/server.js ./
```

### Long-term Fix

1. **Update next.config.mjs** to explicitly use standalone output:

```javascript
// In next.config.mjs
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other config
  output: 'standalone',
  // ... other config
}
```

2. **Update the Dockerfile** to verify the build output structure:

```dockerfile
# After the build step
RUN ls -la .next/ && \
    if [ -d ".next/standalone" ]; then \
      echo "Using standalone output format"; \
    elif [ -d ".next/server" ]; then \
      echo "Using server output format"; \
    else \
      echo "Error: Neither standalone nor server directory found"; \
      exit 1; \
    fi
```

3. **Add conditional copying** based on the build output format:

```dockerfile
# Copy built application based on available structure
RUN if [ -d ".next/standalone" ]; then \
      echo "Copying standalone build"; \
      cp -r .next/standalone/* .; \
      cp -r .next/static ./.next/; \
    else \
      echo "Copying server build"; \
      # Keep the files in place and copy server.js if needed \
    fi
```

## Conclusion

The container is actually running a Next.js server, but there's a mismatch between the expected build output format and the actual one. The server is running on port 3000, but when you try to run it manually, it fails because the port is already in use.

The best approach is to:

1. Ensure the Next.js config and Dockerfile are aligned on the output format
2. Restart the container after making any changes
3. If needed, use a different port for manual testing inside the container

This should resolve the issues with the frontend container in Coolify.
