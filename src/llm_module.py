    IMPORTANT: The user has specified that the overall width of this foundation is {overall_width_inches} inches ({overall_width_inches/12:.1f} feet).

    Your task is to:
    1. Identify any invalid corners in the geometry data
    2. Identify the lengths of each exterior foundation wall, maintaining the wall IDs from the geometry data

    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR IDENTIFYING INVALID CORNERS:
    - This image represents a house foundation floor plan
    - Valid foundation corners are typically where exterior walls meet at roughly 90Â° angles
    - Invalid corners may include:
        * Points detected on curved edges or arcs
        * Points that create very short wall segments
        * Points that are artifacts from text, dimension lines, or other annotations
        * Points that don't represent actual structural corners of the foundation
    - The shape of a typical foundation is rectilinear and consists of straight walls meeting at right angles
    - After removing invalid corners, the remaining valid corners should connect to form a coherent foundation perimeter

    Example: If corners 5, 6, and 7 create tiny segments or were detected on a curved element, you should mark them as invalid.
    
    Here is the OCR extracted text:
    ```
    {ocr_text_str}
    ```

    Look at the image carefully. The foundation plan shows a structure with walls around the perimeter.
    
    Identify each valid wall segment and provide its length in feet and inches.
    Pay special attention to the dimensions labeled in the drawing and ensure they match the user-specified overall width.

    Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    ```json
    {{
      "invalid_corners": [5, 6, 7],  # IDs of corners that are not valid (use actual corner IDs from geometry data)

1. Identify corners that should form right angles based on the overall structure

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FINDING OVERALL WIDTH:
    1. The overall width is ALWAYS shown as the LARGEST dimension at the VERY TOP or VERY BOTTOM of the drawing
    2. Look for dimension lines with arrows at both ends that span the ENTIRE width of the structure
    3. These dimension lines are typically placed outside the perimeter of the building
    4. The overall width is the largest horizontal measurement that spans from the leftmost to rightmost exterior walls
    5. Look for text labels like "38'-0\"" adjacent to these dimension lines
    6. IGNORE all interior dimensions, partial measurements, or dimensions not at the extreme top or bottom
    7. If you see multiple width dimensions, ONLY consider the ones at the very top or very bottom edge of the drawing

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FINDING WALL THICKNESS:
    1. Look for small dimension lines between parallel lines representing walls
    2. Look for text annotations like "8\" WALL" or "8\" THICK WALL"
    3. Look for wall cross-sections that show the thickness
    4. Common foundation wall thicknesses are 6", 8", 10", or 12"
